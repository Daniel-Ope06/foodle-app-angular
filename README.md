<h1>Foodle Web App</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Foodle is my attempt at building an online food market that delivers around a school campus with food truckes. This is my first major Angular project through which I learned a lot of Angular concpets. It also has an admin page that controls the content on the menu page.
